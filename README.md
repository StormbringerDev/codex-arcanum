# Codex Arcanum

The Codex Arcanum is a self-hosted web app for creating and viewing characters for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. Character data is saved as JSON to a database that is stored solely on your own hardware. By default, the Codex uses data from the [System Reference Document v5.1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd#SystemReferenceDocumentv51). You are welcome to add your own data from books you own or homebrew created by you or others. Make sure you actually own the books so the Grand Rules Lawyers at Wizards of the Coast don't banish you to the Abyss.
